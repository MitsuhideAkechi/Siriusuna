# Basic Rules
1. Java is an [OOP](Object-Oriented_Programming(OOP).md) program language.All code in Java must be part of a class.
2. We delimit the beginning and end of segments of code using { and }.
3. All statements in Java must end in a semi-colon.
4. For code to run we need `public static void main(String[] args)`
5. Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared.
6. Java variables must have a specific [type](CS61B/Types.md).
7. Java variable types can never change.
8. Java needs [compiling](Compile.md) so types are verified before the code even runs!
9. Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java.  
    A function that is part of a class is called a "method".  
    So in Java, all functions are methods.
10. All parameters of a function must have a declared type,  
    and the return value of the function must have a declared type, if do not return anything, use `void`.  
    Functions in Java return only one value!
