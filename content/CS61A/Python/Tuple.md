_**An [immutable](Mutable_Variable.md) [Container](Container.md).**_  
We can define a tuple with parentheses, in fact, we can also without any brackets, because any thing separated by commas is evaluated as a tuple.

```python
tuple([1, 2, 3]) # (1, 2, 3)
```

It also can be add, subtract, multiply, can use `in`.

Since tuples are immutable, it is possible to use them as keys in a dictionary.

_**An immutable sequence may still change if it contains a mutable value as its element.**_
