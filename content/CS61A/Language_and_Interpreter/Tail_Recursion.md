_**An optimization method for [Functional_Programming](Functional_Programming.md).**_

We can eliminate the frames we do not need in a recursive call so that we can finish computation in constant space.

Those frame all return a same value, the value returned by the last frame.  
So these middleman are useless after they executed a recursive call.


# Tail Call
_**When have a recursive call, distinguish whether the function has other things to do, or the last thing is just return the value of recursion.**_  
A procedure call that has not yet returned is active. Some procedure calls are tail calls. A Scheme interpreter should support an unbounded number of active tail calls using only a constant amount of space.

A tail call is a call expression in a tail context:
- The last body sub-expression in a `lambda` expression
- Sub-expressions 2(consequent) & 3(alternative) in a tail context `if` expression
- All non-predicate sub-expressions in a tail context `cond`
- The last sub-expression in a tail context `and` or `or`
- The last sub-expression in a tail context `begin`

A call expression is not a tail call if more computation is still required in the calling procedure.  
But linear recursive procedures can often be re-written to use tail calls.

# Map and Reduce
```scheme
(define (reduce procedure s start)
    (if (null? s) start
        (reduce (cdr s) (procedure start (car s)))
    )
)
```
Recursive call is a tail call.  
Other calls are not; constant space depends on whether `procedure` requires constant space.
