# Primitive Types
- `byte`
- `short`
- `int`
- `long`
- `float`
- `double`
- `boolean`
- `char`

# Reference Types
Everything not belonging to [#Primitive_Types](#Primitive_Types.md) is a **reference type**, including arrays.


## Class instantiation
When we instantiate(`new`) an Object (e.g. Dog, Walrus, Planet):
- Java first allocates a box of bits for each instance variable of the class and fills them with a default value (e.g. 0, null).
- The constructor then usually fills every such box with some other value.

Can think of `new` as returning the address of the newly created object
- Addresses in Java are 64 bits.
- Example (rough picture): If object is created in memory location

> So the `new`- allocating memory and returning the address, similar to the `malloc` in C.

## Reference Type Variable Declarations
When we declare a variable of any reference type (Walrus, Dog, Planet):
- Java allocates exactly a box of size 64 bits, no matter what type of object.
- These bits can be either set to:  
    - Null (all zeros).
    - The 64 bit “address” of a specific instance of that class (returned by new).

# The Golden Rule of Equals(GRoE) (and Parameter Passing)
`y = x` **copies** all the bits (pass by value) from x into y.

> So does reference types, in terms of our visual metaphor, we "copy" the arrow by making the arrow in the b box point at the same instance as a.

(Variables that store arrays are reference variables just like any other.)
