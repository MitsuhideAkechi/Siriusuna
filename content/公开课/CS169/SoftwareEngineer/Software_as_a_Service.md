## New Technique
### Background

### AJAX

So we can perceive website as a function returning a bunch of data that our browser will handle using handler function.  
Therefore we can combine lots of website with different functionalities like we `require` library and call them.(That is SOA)

## SOA: Microservice

> All the components are designed to be independent services like you go over the internet to access them, that's the idea of Service Oriented Architecture.  
> So what this means that everyone sits on services if you went over the internet access it's easy to get and replace one. It opens replaceable very easily, it's like to bring down a service and also recover mistakes when it die throw things out in or put them back together. It's much more flexible. 

_**No services can directly name or access another service's data.**_
### SOA vs Silo

 _**There, I could say: SOA is the generalization of Data Abstraction from programming to software engineering.**_  

### Pros/Cons(P83)
> Do one thing very very well.

(Easier to test because of its single effectiveness, harder because of its dependence each other)
## Cloud Computing(Utility Computing)
### Demand

Better than large server for individual

## Conciseness, Synthesis, Reuse, and Tools

# Summary
- Using the same software, Software as a Service is less hassle for developers and users.
- The Service Oriented Architecture makes easy to reuse the current code.
- Is warehouse computing the Scale let to much cheaper so you can resell it, is Utility computing and testing assures software quality and software quality means good for the customer and for the developer.
- And productivity is the way we keep commercial.
